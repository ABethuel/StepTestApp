# StepTestApp
Step test data app

The aerobic capacity test app will be a Windows Form software developed with C# and the framework .NET. 
The aim of this project, his to build an Object-Oriented visual environment which will allow to replace the current manual process for collecting,
analysing, storing “Step Test Data”.

The main objective of this application will therefore be to calculate the aerobic
capacity of a user according to various parameters, such as his/her age or the number of
steps before reaching 85% of his/her HR.

To be more precise, the application will plot the Heart Rate of the user at all levels
of verification until it reaches 85% of its maximum HR for its age. Then, the app will draw
a line graph passing as precisely as possible through all the intermediate points of HR.
This line will then be extended to reach the max HR line for the age of the user. This will
allow the app to effectively predict his aerobic capacity (in mls02/kg/min).

In fact, as you may have realised by now, this application will use exactly the same
principles and methods as the handheld technique. However, the application will solve an
important problem: the accuracy. Indeed, the software will always be more precise to
draw a graph than a human, particularly in this kind of interpolation. This will also make
the process more automatic.

Therefore, this software might be used quite generally in the world of sport,
whether by professionals in the field or by beginners. Both a PE teacher and a coach of a
professional football team could use this application to calculate the aerobic capacity of
their players and students.
